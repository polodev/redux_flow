1. make a view file > src/views/ProgramsView.react.js
2. make a container > src/views/ProgramsContainer.react.js
3. make path of view file and container file > to src/views/index.js
4. add route for the view component > src/routes/index.js
5. make action creator > src/redux/modules/actions/programsActions.js
6. make reducer > src/redux/modules/reducers/ProgramsReducer.js
7. make path of reducer in combine reducer > src/redux/modules/index.js
8. now its time of component make > src/components/Programs/Programs.react.js
9. make path of component > src/components/index.js
